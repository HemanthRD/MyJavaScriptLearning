        /* We can put any type in a variable. For example, a 
        variable can at one moment be a string and then store
        a number. Programming languages that allow such things, such
        as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that
        there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any 
        of them. */
        let message="hello"
        alert(message);
        message=1234;
        alert(message);

        //The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
        let n = 123;
        n = 12.345;

        //boolean type
        let result=true;

        /*
          Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special 
          numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, 
          -Infinity and NaN.

          Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is 
          a special value that’s greater than any number.
          We can get it as a result of division by zero:
          
        */
        alert(1/0); // Infinity
        alert(Infinity); // Infinity

        /*
          NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an 
          incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for 
          instance:

        */
        alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous
        /*
            NaN is sticky. Any further mathematical operation on NaN 
            returns NaN:

            alert( NaN + 1 ); // NaN
            alert( 3 * NaN ); // NaN


            So, if there’s a NaN somewhere in a mathematical 
            expression, it propagates to the whole result 
            (there’s only one exception to that: NaN ** 0 is 1).

            Mathematical operations are safe
            ---------------------------------
            Doing maths is “safe” in JavaScript. We can do anything: divide by zero, 
            treat non-numeric strings as numbers, etc.he script will never stop with
            a fatal error (“die”). At worst, we’ll get NaN as the result.

        For most purposes ±(253-1) range is quite enough, but sometimes we need the 
        entire range of really big integers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.
        BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.

        A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:

        Right now, BigInt is supported in Firefox/Chrome/Edge/Safari, but not in IE.
