           In other words, var variables are defined from the beginning of the function, no matter 
           where the definition is (assuming that the definition is not in the nested function).
           People also call such behavior “hoisting” (raising), because all var are “hoisted” (raised) 
           to the top of the function.

    Because all var declarations are processed at the function start, we can reference them at 
    any place. But variables are undefined until the assignments.In both examples above, alert 
    runs without an error, because the variable phrase exists. But its value is not yet assigned, 
    so it shows undefined.
