/* A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. 
  Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This
  is called an automatic semicolon insertion.
  In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not
  mean “always”! For example:

  alert(3 +
   1
   +2);

   The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is 
   intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an 
   “incomplete expression”, so a semicolon there would be incorrect. And in 
   this case, that works as intended.

   But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon 
   where it is really needed.

   We recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated
    by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community.
