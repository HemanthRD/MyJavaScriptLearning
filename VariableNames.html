             Variable naming
                    There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

                    The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
                    The first character must not be a digit.
        */

        const myBirthday = '03.07.1981';
        /* Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. An 
        attempt to do so would cause an error: */

        alert($);
        alert(_);
        alert(myBirthday);

        /*
                  When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. That is: words go 
                  one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: myVeryLongName.

    /*       let 1a; // cannot start with a digit

             Case matters - JS is case sensitive  
            Variables named apple and APPLE are two different variables.*/

             Uppercase constants
                There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember 
                values that are known prior to execution. Such constants are
                named using capital letters and underscores.
